- Plot: beam intensity loss over dp/p kick versus dp/p
- All orders of Q over time 
- Switch to flat by end of week for commissioning
- Seems like machines are not sensitive to tune/chroma decay as these already occur in other contexts are not compensated for in LSA 

# Measurements
## SFTPRO - 26 GeV MD1 - MEAS

- Start 14:12:43 - End 14:50:47
- Flattened MD1 on sextupoles as this is how we eventually want to run
- 50Hz compensation on
- Strong coupling between V and H tune at extreme dp/p
- Orbit correction (~5mm)
