### MD

'Machine Development'. Used in two contexts:

1. An MD session: A slot of time where we perform experiments on the machine in order to improve machine performance (as opposed to generating data for physics).
2. One of several magnetic cycles, typically called MD1, MD2, etc. These are magnetic cycles which are not intended to produce physics data but rather serve some other purpose in the running of the machine (e.g. MD1 which is intended to lessen hysteresis effects).

### PPM

'Pulse-to-Pulse Modification'. The ability or act of modifying each pulse in a supercycle in an independent, dynamic manner. Also 'PPM-ness', which also refers to the ability or capacity of being able to do so.

## Flattening/depowering MD1

Flattening or depowering MD1 means replacing the current cycle with zeros, i.e. simply running the idle current of the machine for the same amount of time. This is distinct from 'removing' MD1, which would entail actually removing it from the schedule (such that one has, e.g., two SFTPROs 'touching' each other with nothing inbetween).

Depowering MD1 thus saves power, but not time.

### JAPC

'Java API for Parameter Control'. A framework for controlling machines with Java. Needed to get e.g. the real-time IREF from the control software in order to perform hysteresis prediction.
