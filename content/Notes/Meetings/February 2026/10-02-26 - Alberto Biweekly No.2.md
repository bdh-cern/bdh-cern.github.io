vs
- Alberto has measured the fields but cannot play the LHC-MD1-SFTPRO SC more than twice, because the power converters then hit a limit on the RMS fields
	- This limitation means he has to put +20 BPs between LHC and MD1
	- However, this means that the measurement he is doing is **not comparable** to the machine cycle because the eddie cirrents from the idle -> injection plateau is not complete 
- The B1 increases with time on the injection plateau because of the decay of the eddies
- The new incorporation rule will likely cause issues because the ramp is probably too steep, and will cause eddies
- The longer the ramp, the better for eddies
