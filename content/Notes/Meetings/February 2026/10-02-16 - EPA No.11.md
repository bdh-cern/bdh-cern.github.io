- New NMR installed in B-train
	- NMR at top and bottom 
	- Anton requires 1e-5 T on flat-bottom
	- Scanning NMR has range of a few mT
- Simulated B-train
	- Magnets team not in control of when the B-train switches from real to simulated
	- Published to same place in NXCALS
	- Not sure if they are accessible from the same device in whatever scheme Anton is using
