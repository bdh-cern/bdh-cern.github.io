- 12 sectors of 62 dipoles each = all sps dipoles
	- One sector has +2 b-train dipoles (so 64 in total for that one)
	- The SPS thus has 742 ring dipoles and 2 B-Train dipoles
- Flux meters give integral by field in the B-Train dipoles to 1e-4T precision
- NMR marker correction at 1e-5T
	- Only work in dipoles as they need a constant field in time (~ms) and space
	- Quads have significant field gradient, so no lock. Hall sensors instead
- Hall sensors 1e-3 T
- A unit is 1e-4T (1 Gauss?)
	- Can be relative or absolute. 
- New scanning NMR in B-Train (in addition to the point NMR used to reset the integration drift)
	- This will be calibrated and tested soon. Possibly going to NXCALs next few months.
	- Properly installed alongside the new PCB fluxmeters in LS3
- Why isn't the measurement cycle in [[01-12-25 MD - Cancelled Chroma Scans]] flat?

To Do:
- [ ] Make some slides for the weekly on 29th (Carlo and Alberto attending)
