- Trim without driving
	- Send to LSA without sending to the machines
	- drive=False somewhere
- UCAP actor for the actual trim
- Test the app whenever the machine is pulsing
- Simulated B-Train already exists?
	- Test the mechanics of the application

- Modify the app so that it produces a single flat-top trim
	- Flat delta on the flat-top
	- Do this by making a trim class in actions package
	- App does not do a clean trim, but rather applies a wobbly function
- MEAS will be the same shape as the cancelled MD measurement cycle (this is the default)

1. Change app to apply a single flat-top trim
2. Simulated B-train app test
3. Test UCAP with actor such that it can send a trim to NEXT as well
4. 11th, 12th, simulated to real B-train and test app


====

- Do I have to set up logging for the output of the app on NEXT?
