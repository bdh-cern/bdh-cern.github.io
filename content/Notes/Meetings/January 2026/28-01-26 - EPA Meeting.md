- CTSB Long term strategy for controls
- Michael presenting EPA overview at Chamonix
- DBS only been present in PS since 2025 as part of EPA
	- Beam-time sharing improvement
	- Efficient LHC filling
	- 2026: Autonomous SC scheduling and execution; DBS can recalculate and activate new SC (rather than populating the same SC under given constraints) - how is this different?
	- ~52 SC changes per day, 2-25min -> seconds
- Automated LHC filling
	- Automate mode switching and beam prep 
	- 'Building blocks' including wire-scans, LBO, TL steering (?)
	- Automated corrective trims 
	- Definition of beam quality and quality constraints
- Automatic parameter optimisation
	- Optimisers deployed amongst injectors
	- More experience in 2026
	- Investigation of ML optimisers
- Hysteresis compensation
	- 36h operational test in 2025
	- 4.6 GWh/yr (300 kCHF) saving per year purely from depowering MD1 (26GeV) for 2,4-poles
	- Only SFTPRO uses MD1 (?)
		- MD1 is the only one to degauss dipoles (and quadrupoles?)
		- In TT2 all 6,8-poles are degaussed before every transfer
	- Multi-function magnets studied in lab this year
- Autonomous equipment
	- AqFlow for 'pilots'?
