# Michael, talking about UCAP:


- Nodes need RBAC to make trims
- Python convertors must use Java actors to actually make trims
- - aacp-py app riun ucap-console --expert
- ucap logging website
- gitlabs.cern.ch/dsb --- devops python template
- Use event to many to publish logs as well as data
- CO Diag -> JAPC toolbox (This is where the device names are I think)
- All device definitions available on CCDE
- Greg Kruk - timing problems
- XTIM is timing devices; XTIM.PX.SXY-CT e.g. cycle start for PS
- acc-py devrelease . --- publishes a dev version of the next tag to acc-py
- Example UCAP project: https://gitlab.cern.ch/mischenk/ucap-tutorial-schenk
