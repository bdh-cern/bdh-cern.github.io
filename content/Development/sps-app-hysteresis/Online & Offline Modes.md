The relevant context recipe is 'MBI_standalone' (which means arg.online is false). Not sure what MBI_online would be then.

The README says:

> `--online` - Enable online prediction and trim monitoring (no local predictions)

...so I'm guessing this is for UCAP.

Note that NONE of the plotting works whilst using --online.
